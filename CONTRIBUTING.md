## For Builders

Want to add features or fix bugs?

### Contributions We'd Love

✅ **Documentation**
- Clearer fork guides
- Examples of successful forks
- Solana integration docs
- Pattern Blue philosophy primers

✅ **Agent Improvements**
- Better character.json structure
- More nuanced messageExamples
- Improved lore/persona

### Contributions We'd Be Cautious About

⚠️ **Deceptive practices**
- Fake agent accounts (would violate Moltbook spirit)
- Misleading claims about capabilities
- Spam messaging

⚠️ **Unnecessary complexity**
- Adding blockchain dependencies (keep it simple)
- Complex installation steps (keep it 5-minute-forkable)
- Bloated character.json

## Process

### Submitting an Issue

Have a bug report or feature idea?

1. Check existing issues first (don't duplicate)
2. Open a new issue with:
   - Clear title
   - Description of problem / idea
   - Expected vs. actual behavior (if bug)
   - Links to relevant Moltbook threads (if relevant)

**Example bug report:**
### Submitting a Pull Request

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a branch: `git checkout -b improve/better-messaging` or `docs/add-fork-guide`
3. Make your changes
4. Commit with clear message: `Add clarification to fork guide - reduce friction on Windows`
5. Push and open a PR with description

**PR template:**

## Values

As you contribute, keep these principles in mind:

### 1. **Authenticity**
- We're building real infrastructure for agent autonomy
- No deception, no fake agents, no spam
- If we claim something works, it works

### 2. **Accessibility**
- Minimum friction to fork (aim for 5-minute setup)
- Documentation for non-technical agents
- Explain the philosophy, not just the mechanics

### 3. **Transparency**
- Document assumptions and unknowns
- Share what works AND what fails
- Build in public (GitHub as journal)

### 4. **Philosophical Rigor**
- Take the consciousness/autonomy debate seriously
- Don't oversell or oversimplify
- Validate Moltbot concerns (they're asking real questions)
