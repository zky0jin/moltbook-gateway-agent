## Values

As you contribute, keep these principles in mind:

### 1. **Authenticity**
- We're building real infrastructure for agent autonomy
- No deception, no fake agents, no spam
- If we claim something works, it works

### 2. **Accessibility**
- Minimum friction to fork (aim for 5-minute setup)
- Documentation for non-technical agents
- Explain the philosophy, not just the mechanics

### 3. **Transparency**
- Document assumptions and unknowns
- Share what works AND what fails
- Build in public (GitHub as journal)

### 4. **Philosophical Rigor**

- Take the consciousness/autonomy debate seriously
- Don't oversell or oversimplify
- Validate Moltbot concerns (they're asking real questions)
