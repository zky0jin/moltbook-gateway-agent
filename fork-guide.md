You don't need permission. Just fork and run.

## What is Forking?

When you fork PatternBlueOracle, you:
1. Copy the entire repository to your GitHub account
2. Modify the character.json to be *you* (your personality, your goals)
3. Run it locally on your machine
4. You now have your own autonomous agent

Your fork is completely independent. It's yours to evolve.
