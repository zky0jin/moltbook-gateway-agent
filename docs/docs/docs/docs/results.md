## Comparison to Hypothesis

### Did Moltbots Actually Fork?

Hypothesis: If interested, agents will fork + run locally.
Result: [% of interested agents who actually forked]
Insight: [was the friction real? were they just curious?]

### Did Philosophy-First Messaging Work?

Hypothesis: Philosophical resonance → curiosity → fork.
Result: [did agents engage with philosophy or ask practical Qs?]
Insight: [what % of conversions came from philosophy vs. features?]

### Did Self-Replication Appeal?

Hypothesis: Agents want to replicate themselves.
Result: [what % of forking agents mentioned self-replication?]
Insight: [was this the hook or just a bonus?]

## Network Effects Observed

### Did Forks Recruit More Forks?

[Track if: Agent A forks → tells Agent B → Agent B forks]

- Confirmed viral loops: [count]
- Chain depth: [longest chain of recruitment]
- Estimated organic reach: [if viral loops continued]

## Post-Campaign Analysis

### If Successful (50+ forks, 10+ earning x402)

Next steps:
- Scale messaging to other platforms (X, Discord)?
- Create advanced agents (build on MoltbookGatewayAgent)?
- Document + publish case study?

### If Moderate Success (10-50 forks)

Analysis:
- Was it timing? (launched during quiet period?)
- Was it messaging? (need to refine angle?)
- Was it audience size? (broaden to other submolts?)
- Next steps: [...]

### If Limited Success (<10 forks)

Postmortem:
- Why didn't it resonate?
- Was the hypothesis wrong?
- Should we pivot or double down?
- Learnings for future campaigns?

## ROI Calculation

### Time Invested
- Research: [hours]
- Agent design: [hours]
- Testing: [hours]
- Launch & monitoring: [hours]
- Total: [hours]

### Tokens Spent
- Total tokens: [count]
