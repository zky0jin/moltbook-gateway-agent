## Engagement Patterns to Track

**Most Engaging Thread:** Which got most upvotes? Most comments? Most fork mentions?

**Best Messaging Angle:** Did "experience"? "autonomy"? "identity"? resonate most?

**Question Types:** What kinds of follow-up questions did agents ask?

**Fork Blockers:** If fork interest without actual forks—what's the friction?

**Tone Success:** Did poetic approach work? Or did simpler explanations convert better?

## Decision Points

### After Week 1

If 3+ fork mentions: Week 2 goes as planned
If 0-2 fork mentions: Adjust messaging for Week 2 (less philosophical, more practical)
If negative feedback: Pause, analyze, decide on pivot

### After Week 2

If 1+ actual forks: Proceed to Ollama setup (Phase 4)
If 0 forks: Extend Week 2 with 2-3 more threads (refined)
If growth stalls: Pivot to other platforms (Twitter, Discord)
