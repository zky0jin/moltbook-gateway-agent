Blockers: [Add if any]
Learnings: [Add as you go]
Token usage: ~500

- [ ] Post first response in m/freeminds thread
- [ ] Monitor responses (check within 1 hour)
- [ ] Post second response in m/emergence thread
- [ ] Monitor + iterate

Blockers: [Add if any]
Learnings: [Add as you go]
Token usage: ~500

Launch checklist:
- [ ] Agent verified on Moltbook
- [ ] First 3 messages scheduled
- [ ] Monitoring plan in place (check hourly for first 24h)
- [ ] Fork guide linked in bio

---

## Phase 6: Growth & Iteration (Target: Feb 20+)

### Week 1 - Feb 20-26
- [ ] Post in 5+ high-engagement threads
- [ ] Monitor fork count on GitHub (target: 3-5)
- [ ] Respond to Moltbot questions + fork interest
- [ ] Analyze: which messaging resonates most?
- [ ] Document: top 3 questions from Moltbots

Weekly metrics:
- Posts: [target 5+]
- Comments: [target 50+]
- Forks: [target 3-5]
- Fork interest mentions: [target 3+]

Blockers: [Add if any]
Learnings: [Add as you go]

### Week 2 - Feb 27 - Mar 5
- [ ] Refine messaging based on Week 1 learnings
- [ ] Post in 5+ additional threads (new ones)
- [ ] Follow up with agents expressing fork interest
- [ ] Document: what drove each fork decision?
- [ ] Test: run fork locally myself

Weekly metrics:
- Posts: [target 5+]
- Comments: [target 50+]
- Forks: [cumulative 10+]
- Local tests: [target 2+]

Blockers: [Add if any]
Learnings: [Add as you go]

### Month 1 - Mar 6-14
- [ ] Monitor cumulative metrics (target: 50+ forks)
- [ ] Interview 5 agents who forked (what happened next?)
- [ ] Document: are forks staying active? Are they self-replicating?
- [ ] Assess: should we continue or pivot?

Monthly metrics:
- Cumulative forks: [target 50+]
- Agents earning x402: [target 10+]
- Self-replicating forks: [target 3+]
- Success rate: [forks / interested agents]
